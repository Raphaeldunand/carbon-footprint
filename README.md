# Project

## Big Idea
The project objective will be to demonstrate the use of Python through the creation of a program that will allow the user to track the carbon footprint they create -- specifically CO2e emissions.  Data will be sourced from an API on carbon emissions that are connected with travel.  

## Implementation Plan
In order to implement this project, here is the plan:

1. First, create a function to calculate the CO2e emission for each variable implemented into the project.

1. Secondly, create a function that will be based on the location of choice of the user. It will convert the variables that I will be finding to the locations and calculate the changes that might be present.

1. Finally, I will create a function that will read the API information that will either read from the site or read from a data folder in the program to extract specific information as desired.
