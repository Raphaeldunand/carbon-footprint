# Project

## Big Idea
The project objective will be to demonstrate the use of Python through the creation of a program that will allow the user to track the carbon footprint they create -- specifically CO2e emissions.  Data will be sourced from an API on carbon emissions that are connected with travel.  

## Implementation Plan
In order to implement this project, here is the plan:

1. First, create a function to calculate the CO2e emission for each variable implemented into the project.

1. Secondly, create a function that will be based on the location of choice of the user. It will convert the variables that I will be finding to the locations and calculate the changes that might be present.

1. Finally, I will create a function that will read the API information that will either read from the site or read from a data folder in the program to extract specific information as desired.


# Instructions
In order to run this code, you will have to first ensure that you have flask and Haversine downloaded to your computer. You wil have to do this through the command prompt on your device.
--python -m pip install haversine
--pip install Flask

Then you will need to go to the routes.py document in this repository in your vscode and run the document. After doing so, you are going to be lead to a server deployed from your terminal. once you click this you will be able to view and input infomration into the forms on the html site.
